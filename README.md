## Hi frens ðŸ‘¾

I'm Albiona or [albicodes](https://twitter.com/albicodes) on socials

I'm the developer advocacy lead at [zkSync Era](https://era.zksync.io/docs/dev/). Thanks to the open-source movement and contributing in any way possible, I'm where I am. I'm a bootstrapper; I love new challenges and providing actionable pathways for my team and me. 

I started in web3 with Manta Network, and before that, I was a DevRel for a serverless framework called Webiny (YC 21). Before this, I was a remote full-stack developer and an open-source/community builder. 

I started initiatives such as
