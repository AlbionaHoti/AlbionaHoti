## Hi frens 👾

I'm Albiona or [albicodes](https://twitter.com/albicodes) on socials

I'm the developer advocacy lead at [zkSync Era](https://era.zksync.io/docs/dev/). Thanks to the open-source movement and contributing in any way possible, I'm where I am. I'm a bootstrapper; I love new challenges and providing actionable pathways for my team and me. 

I started in web3 with [Manta Network](https://manta.network/), and before that, I was a DevRel for a serverless framework called [Webiny (YC 21)](https://www.webiny.com/). Before this, I was a remote full-stack developer and an open-source/community builder. 

I started initiatives such as

▪️ Coder Gals NGO [An organization to help students get into open-source]

▪️ Toastmasters Prishtina [The first public speaking club in Kosovo to accelerate public speaking skils for students with any background, but specifically focusing on STEM students]


▪️ Brought DebConf (Debian OS) in Kosovo in 2021 [The first huge open-source conference (600 people) organized in my home town, Prizren, Kosovo] 


▪️ My current initiatives include:

* Privacy In Web3
  > We at the [Privacy In Web3](https://twitter.com/privacyinweb3) are dedicated to increase awareness of privacy solutions in Web3.
