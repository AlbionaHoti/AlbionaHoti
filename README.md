## Hi frens 👾

I'm Albiona or [albicodes](https://twitter.com/albicodes) on socials

I'm the developer advocacy lead at [zkSync Era](https://zksync.io/). Thanks to contributing to open-source, I was introduced to real-world projects remotely, and from that experience, I continued my open-source contribution in many hybrid ways. I love new challenges and providing actionable ways to push to accelerate results which everyone can benefit from.

I started in web3 with [Manta Network](https://manta.network/), and before that, I was a DevRel for a serverless framework called [Webiny (YC 21)](https://www.webiny.com/). Before this, I was a remote full-stack developer & an open-source contributor & community builder. 

I started initiatives such as

▪️ (Coder Gals NGO)[https://www.instagram.com/codergalsks/] [An organization to help students get into open-source]

▪️ (Toastmasters Prishtina)[https://www.facebook.com/PrishtinaToastmastersClub] [The first public speaking club in Kosovo to accelerate public speaking skils for students with any background, but specifically focusing on STEM students]


▪️ Brought DebConf (Debian OS) in Kosovo in 2021 [The first huge open-source conference (600 people) organized in my home town, Prizren, Kosovo] 


▪️ My current initiatives include:

* Privacy In Web3
  > We at the [Privacy In Web3](https://twitter.com/privacyinweb3) are dedicated to increase awareness of privacy solutions in Web3.
